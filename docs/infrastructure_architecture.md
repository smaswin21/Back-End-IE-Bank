## Modular Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Our infrastructure is defined and managed using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** principles, leveraging **Azure Bicep** templates for declarative resource provisioning. The modular approach enhances reusability, maintainability, and clarity across all environments.


### Modularization Strategy

Modularity is key to designing infrastructure code that is scalable and easy to manage. Each module represents an Azure service, encapsulating its configuration and deployment logic. 

#### Goals of Modularization:
- **Maintainability**: Isolate components for easier updates and debugging.
- **Reusability**: Enable modules to be reused across environments and projects.
- **Scalability**: Allow new modules to be added without impacting existing ones.
- **Testability**: Simplify testing by isolating modules.
- **Flexibility**: Allow easy swapping of modules with the same interface.

#### Directory Structure

The infrastructure is broken into logical components, with each module in its respective directory:

- **`modules/`**: The root directory for modular templates.
  - **`applications/`**: Modules for application services (e.g., App Services for backend and frontend).
  - **`databases/`**: Modules for deploying PostgreSQL resources.
  - **`infrastructure/`**: Shared modules for Key Vault, Log Analytics, and Application Insights.
- **`main.bicep`**: Orchestrates the deployment of all modules using input parameters.



### Benefits of Modularization

1. **Maintainability**: Centralized changes in modules without affecting the overall infrastructure.
2. **Reusability**: Modules are shared across environments, saving effort.
3. **Scalability**: Easy addition of services to support new features.
4. **Testability**: Isolated modules allow for focused testing and validation.
5. **Flexibility**: Swappable components with the same interface ensure seamless integration.



### Resource Dependency Graph

The following diagram illustrates the dependencies between modules:

## Security and Monitoring

### GitHub Advanced Security

#### GitHub Secret Scanning
GitHub Secret Scanning was configured across repositories to detect and prevent the accidental inclusion of sensitive data such as API keys, tokens, and passwords in the codebase. This scanning tool alerts developers to potential exposures, enabling immediate remediation and reducing the risk of compromised credentials.

#### Protected Main Branches
To secure the main branches, branch protection rules were implemented. We required a pull request before merging, enforced code review approval, and mandated a linear commit history. This configuration was applied across all main branches to maintain code integrity.

#### CodeQL for Code Scanning
CodeQL was integrated as a semantic code analysis tool to detect vulnerabilities in both the frontend (Vue.js) and backend (Python). The tool systematically scans for potential security flaws and logical errors, providing insights into code safety while facilitating secure development practices.

#### OSSF Scorecard
The OSSF Scorecard was utilized to evaluate the security posture of workflows and repositories. This tool provided a detailed analysis of security practices, including checks on code reviews, dependency management, and CI/CD configurations, enabling the team to identify and address areas for improvement.

#### Dependabot
To automate dependency updates and maintain up-to-date packages, Dependabot was activated. It automatically generates pull requests for updates to dependencies, mitigating risks posed by outdated or vulnerable libraries. Alongside this, dependency reviews were set up to analyze changes and assess their security implications during the pull request process.

#### Dependency Reviews
Dependency reviews were set up to analyze changes and assess their security implications during the pull request process. This ensured unwanted dependencies were identified and addressed before merging.

#### CODEOWNERS
The CODEOWNERS file was configured in each repository to establish clear ownership of code sections. This ensures that changes to critical areas of the codebase are reviewed by designated experts, maintaining accountability and adherence to security standards.



### Secure Secrets Management

#### Key Vault
For robust secrets management, Azure Key Vault was integrated into the infrastructure to securely store credentials such as API keys, container registry tokens, and PostgreSQL server passwords. This approach centralizes sensitive information, encrypts it, and provides fine-grained access control to authorized entities only.

#### Managed Identity
We also leveraged Managed Identities to eliminate the need for hard-coded credentials. By granting applications and services secure, temporary access to resources, this solution enhances security while simplifying credential management.



### Security Frameworks

#### OpenSSF

##### Regex for Input Validation
To enhance security through the OpenSSF framework, we implemented regex-based input validation across our applications. This measure enforces strict formatting rules for data inputs, preventing malicious injections such as SQL, XML, or script-based attacks.

##### Npm Best Practices
As part of OpenSSF guidelines, we adopted npm best practices to secure the management of frontend dependencies. This included locking dependency versions, running regular vulnerability scans with Dependabot, and removing unused packages to minimize the attack surface.

##### Evaluating Open Source Software
We implemented a structured process for evaluating open-source software to minimize risks from third-party dependencies. This included assessing project activity levels, reviewing contributor trustworthiness, and checking for regular updates or responses to reported vulnerabilities.

##### Source Code Management Platform Configuration
To align with OpenSSF practices, we fortified our source code management platform with robust configuration settings. Repository access was restricted based on roles, branch protection rules were enforced, and detailed audit logs were maintained.

#### SAFECode

##### Standardize Identity and Access Management
Under SAFECode principles, we standardized identity and access management practices to ensure secure and consistent access control. By implementing role-based access control (RBAC), we enforced the principle of least privilege, granting users only the permissions necessary for their roles.

##### Establish Log Requirements and Audit Practices
Logging and auditing requirements were defined to track system activities comprehensively. Logs included information on user actions, authentication attempts, and system changes.

##### Establish Coding Standards and Conventions
SAFECode principles guided the creation of coding standards and conventions that prioritized security. These standards mandated secure patterns for error handling, input sanitization, and encryption.

##### Use Code Analysis Tools to Find Security Vulnerabilities
We integrated CodeQL into our project to quickly identify security vulnerabilities. This tool is further complemented by third-party audits, allowing us to enhance our security posture continuously.

##### Handle Errors
Error handling practices were established to ensure sensitive information was not exposed through system-generated messages. Errors were logged for internal debugging but raised as generic messages to end-users.



### Monitoring and Alerting

#### Application Insights
- **Purpose**: Monitors application performance, availability, and user behavior.
- **Features**:
  - Collects telemetry data from applications.
  - Configured with alert rules for critical metrics.
  - Integrated with Logic Apps for alert notifications.

#### Alert Rules
- **Login Response Time Alert**:
  - **Name**: `Login-SLO-Alert`
  - **Description**: Triggers when login response time exceeds 5 seconds.
  - **Severity**: 2
  - **Action**: Sends an alert via the Logic App to Slack.

  - **Name**: `Page-Load-Time-Alert`
  - **Description**: Triggers when page load time exceeds 5 seconds.
  - **Severity**: 4
  - **Action**: Sends an alert via the Logic App to Slack.
