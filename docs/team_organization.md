The product roadmap focuses on how our next 4 fiscal quarters are going to look like. The first quarter (the one we are in) focuses on getting the app up and running, setting up security and monitoring strategies and implementing CI/CD. The first and second quarters also focus on deploying to production and ensuring all features of the app are working. The third and fourth quarters focus on receiving feedback from the users, making the app better and more user friendly, and start marketing it to the users to compete with bigger competitors in the market and stand out to new potential users.

## Sprint Planning Ceremony

Link for [Sprint Planning Ceremony](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MIUTjas9CrbjAQA3bDOTuj3iRrXdAbb6?usp=drive_link) which is the first video in the file.

We had 3 recorded daily scrum meetings, as the rest were conducted in person which was a bit difficult. Each meeting focused on discussing what everyone has accomplished since our last meeting, what they are doing right now and what they are going to do next. Also in such meetings we tried to cover any concerns and ask each other questions because the success of this project relies on heavy collaboration. In the video Scrum meeting 1, we performed the sprint planning and backlog refinement to make sure that everyone fully understood the backlog and how to use it. Also, I continuously updated the backlog for refinements and when I receive feedback I update the backlog so it aligns as much as possible with our sprint.

## Scrum Methodology

Everything previously mentioned contributed to implementing the Scrum methodology in this sprint, these are the following methodologies that were used:
1.  I ensured we implemented all concepts and principles from the agile methodology for planning and collaborating. This sprint relied on the communication and efficient collaboration between different team members in order to get work down, especially between the infrastructure developer and all other team members to ensure efficient deployment to production.
2.  A backlog was prepared and continuously refined by me (product owner) throughout the sprint, so that the team members can have a sense of direction and we used the user stories to make sure we are satisfying customer needs and remain user-centric
3.  Daily scrum meetings were carried out as much as possible and as long as needed so that everyone is updated of the otherâ€™s progress, cover any doubts and to make sure everyone is on track at that point in the sprint
4.  A sprint review was conducted on 29/11 to show what we have completed in this sprint, each team member gave an update, we presented our demo in the UAT environment, discussed technical debt of the sprint and what we aim to complete next. The sprint review also reflected how team collaboration was essential in completing all tasks in this sprint.
5.  A sprint retrospective was conducted on 4/12 to show what each member believed was done well, what should be improved and shout outs. The general consensus showed that our strongest factor was the team dynamic and collaboration. Each team member however saw ways in which they can contribute improvements to the next sprint. As for the shout outs, it can be clearly seen how in a way each member was thankful for the help of almost everyone.
