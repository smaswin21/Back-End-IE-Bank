### Infrastructure Release Strategy for MONEY404-Bank Project

The **Infrastructure Release Strategy** is a critical component in ensuring that the MONEY404-Bank project delivers secure, reliable, and scalable banking services to its users. This expanded strategy delves deeper into the processes, tools, and best practices that will guide infrastructure deployments across all environmentsâ€”Development (Dev), User Acceptance Testing (UAT), and Production (Prod).

## Environment Deployment Process (DTAP)

### Development (Dev)

The **Development (Dev)** environment serves as a **sandbox** where developers can **experiment**, **learn**, and **validate** infrastructure updates. It features **automated provisioning**, ensuring infrastructure is deployed seamlessly upon code commits to **feature branches**. Through **resource management**, it optimizes expenses by utilizing **cost-effective SKUs**. Additionally, the environment provides **wider access** to developers, enabling **rapid iteration** and fostering innovation.

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

The **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** environment serves as a **pre-production** stage where **stakeholders** can **test** and **validate** new features and infrastructure changes. It is designed with **production parity**, ensuring it mirrors the **production environment** in both configurations and resources for **accurate testing**. Deployments are **controlled**, initiated via **pull requests** to maintain **code quality**. Additionally, **limited access** is granted to **business users**, enabling them to perform **acceptance testing** and confirm that changes meet their requirements before moving to production.

### Production (Prod)

The **Production (Prod)** environment is the **live environment** dedicated to serving **end-users** with **stable** and **thoroughly tested** infrastructure and application updates. It is designed with **high availability**, leveraging **redundant resources** to ensure **maximum uptime**. **Strict access control** is implemented and carefully monitored to maintain **security**. Additionally, the environment features **performance monitoring**, ensuring **optimal performance** and an exceptional **user experience** at all times. It is important to note that currently the resources are replicated consistently across stages.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Azure Bicep

- The project uses Azure Bicep for declarative and modular infrastructure definitions.
- Modularization enables reusability and flexibility, with separate modules for core resources like App Services, Key Vault, Azure Container Registry (ACR), and PostgreSQL.
- Parameter files differentiate configurations per environment (e.g., resource naming conventions, SKUs, and access controls).

### Code Management

- **Version Control:** All Bicep files are stored in a Git repository with proper Git strategies to manage changes effectively.
- **Code Reviews:** Mandatory pull request reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.
- **Template Validation:** Automated checks to validate Bicep templates for syntax and compliance before deployment.


## Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

### GitHub Actions Workflow

- **Event Triggers:**
  - **Feature Branch Push:** Deploys to Dev environment for immediate feedback.
  - **Pull Request to Main:** Initiates deployment to UAT after passing all tests.
  - **Merge to Main Branch:** Triggers deployment to Production environment.
- **Pipeline Stages:**
  1. **Build Stage:** Compiles Bicep templates and packages artifacts.
  2. **Test Stage:** Runs unit tests, integration tests.
  3. **Deploy Stage:** Applies infrastructure changes using Azure CLI.

### Quality Assurance

- **Bicep Linting:** Enforces coding standards and best practices using tools like `bicep linter`.
- **Preflight Testing:** Assures the code we are about to deploy will not cause conflicts or additional issues on Azure.

#### **Deployment Strategies**

Current deployment strategy is spanning from DEV to PROD

#### **Monitoring and Alerting**
- Integration with Azure Application Insights and Log Analytics ensures proactive monitoring.
- Logic Apps and Slack alerts notify the team of critical infrastructure issues in real time.


## Conclusion

The expanded Infrastructure Release Strategy for the MONEY404-Bank project provides a comprehensive roadmap for managing infrastructure deployments effectively across all environments. By embracing automation, modular design, and robust monitoring, the strategy ensures that the project can deliver high-quality banking services with agility and confidence.
